# GitHub-tutorial
 
This is a readme file. On the repository page of GitHub, it is rendered as the main webpage of the repository. It is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language. It is a good idea to write a readme file for each repository, so that other people can understand what the repository is about and how to use it.

It supports various formatting options, such as **bold**, *italic*, and `code`. You can also include links, images, and tables. For more information, see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Subheading 1
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
### Sub-subheading 1
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
## Subheading 2
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

## Codes in Markdown

It is also possible to include code blocks, which will be syntax-highlighted. For example, the following code block is written in Python.
    
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

The following is written in R.

```r
hello <- function() {
    print("Hello, world!")
}
```
